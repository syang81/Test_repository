Test Automation for me
I was a mechanical engineer previously, after I came to US I realized I need to change I caree to IT field. So I took some QA course in a trainning school. Then I worked in Practical SQA company for 3 years, the project I joined was a web-based application, called assessment control, which is an educational platform. At the beginning, it was open requirements, we tried to build everything from scratch. I started from exploratory testing, and created test cases including positive, negative and boundary condition. Executed them in different browsers and OS to make sure the app is compatible with them. For automation we use Java - a core Language with Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber. IntelliJ IDEA as Integrated Development Environment. 
After that I worked in Cisco, I developed test plan, designed and executed test cases per clientâ€™s requirement. Create and write tcs for a cisco network academy application. Create tcs for new feature and new component, figure out the exact issue of all the failures from regression results, fixed script issues and file bugs immediately to the bug tracking system. Most of time, I performed manual testing for regression results. I use Squish IDEA to write test cases and run regrssion test. My contract is end for 6 months working in Cisco. So I need to find another job. I want to do automation testing job in the further and learn more about automation testing.
